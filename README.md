Qard projects(personal)

With the attached PDF (test1.pdf), implement a way to extract tokens representing companies out of it. We want to use spark with pyspark (on the local machine) for the execution framework

If you wish to see the result, check Qard_Case_Study_SparkOCR+SpacyNER_CamembertNER.ipynb, the implementation is there

In Qard_Case_Study_test_NER.ipynb, you can find some exploration on multiple techniques that I tried. Some of them are not chosen to be used in the implementation.
